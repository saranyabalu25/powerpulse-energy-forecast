⚡ PowerPulse: Household Energy Usage Forecast
🔗 Dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption
The dataset used for this project is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It contains over 2 million measurements of electric power consumption in one household, recorded over nearly four years.

🧠 Project Overview
PowerPulse aims to develop a predictive model for household electricity consumption using time-series data. By analyzing historical usage patterns, this project provides actionable insights to optimize energy usage for individuals and improve demand forecasting for providers.

This project blends data science with sustainability, offering not only a robust regression model but also visual interpretations of consumption behaviors across time.

🎯 Objectives
Predict household electricity usage using machine learning.

Uncover key features influencing energy consumption.

Enable smarter energy decisions via forecasts and trend analysis.

🔍 Dataset Description
Main Features:

Date and Time: Timestamp for each reading.

Global_active_power: Household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatts).

Additional attributes include voltage, intensity, sub-metering variables, etc.

The dataset allows granular analysis by minute, hour, day, and month.

🔧 Methodology
1. 📊 Data Preprocessing
Handled missing and invalid values.

Combined Date and Time columns into a single Datetime feature.

Converted relevant fields to numeric types.

Resampled data to daily level for modeling stability.

2. 🧱 Feature Engineering
Extracted time-based features: hour, day, month, weekday, is_weekend.

Created lag and rolling average features to capture trends.

Feature importance analysis performed to rank predictors.

3. 🤖 Modeling and Evaluation
Used regression models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Evaluated using:

RMSE

MAE

R² Score

4. 📈 Visualization
Hourly, daily, and monthly trends plotted using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Heatmaps, line plots, and bar charts highlighted behavioral patterns and feature impact.

📌 Key Insights
Morning and evening peaks align with typical household routines.

Weekend usage patterns differ, indicating lifestyle impact on consumption.

Seasonal trends suggest increased power consumption in colder months.

Feature importance showed that month, hour, and rolling averages were highly predictive.
